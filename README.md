# game game

I was messing around trying to make a scrabble board. Some notable things:

- Written in Zig. I finally got on the Zig train
- Uses raylib. What a nice library.
- Using jj to manage version control. Just out of curiosity.

Eventually, I'd like to try:

- Fleshing out more of the game
- [x] Compiling to wasm and putting it up on the web.
- making this network multiplayer?
- or maybe a single-player game?

Some next things to add:

- hover when hand is empty and you hover over a tile
